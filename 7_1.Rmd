# Synthetic Control

## Comparative Politics: German Reunification

```{r}
require(foreign)
germany <- read.dta('~/Downloads/repgermany.dta')
summary(germany)
```

## Euro and Debt

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
source('~/Downloads/Replication files/Kohler_replication files/analysis.R')
load('~/Downloads/Replication files/Kohler_replication files/scdata.RData')
source('~/Downloads/Replication files/Kohler_replication files/euro11.R')

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
