## 7_1 Synthetic

Install R’s “Synth” package and run the “toy data” example in the *synth *function’s help file (i.e., Example 1). Experiment with the functionality. Come prepared to consider what a placebo test would be in this context, and try to use the toy dataset to perform such a test. (Consider two kinds of placebo tests—tests in time, and tests in space). Tests in time are discussed in the optional reading from the Journal of Statistical Software.

```{r}
require(Synth)
## First Example: Toy panel dataset

# load data
data(synth.data)

# create matrices from panel data that provide inputs for synth()
dataprep.out<-
  dataprep(
   foo = synth.data,
   predictors = c("X1", "X2", "X3"),
   predictors.op = "mean",
   dependent = "Y",
   unit.variable = "unit.num",
   time.variable = "year",
   special.predictors = list(
      list("Y", 1991, "mean"),
      list("Y", 1985, "mean"),
      list("Y", 1980, "mean")
                            ),
   treatment.identifier = 7,
   controls.identifier = c(29, 2, 13, 17, 32, 38),
   time.predictors.prior = c(1984:1989),
   time.optimize.ssr = c(1984:1990),
   unit.names.variable = "name",
   time.plot = 1984:1996
   )

## run the synth command to identify the weights
## that create the best possible synthetic 
## control unit for the treated.
synth.out <- synth(dataprep.out)

## there are two ways to summarize the results
## we can either access the output from synth.out directly
round(synth.out$solution.w,2)
# contains the unit weights or
synth.out$solution.v 
## contains the predictor weights. 

## the output from synth opt 
## can be flexibly combined with 
## the output from dataprep to 
## compute other quantities of interest
## for example, the period by period 
## discrepancies between the 
## treated unit and its synthetic control unit
## can be computed by typing
gaps<- dataprep.out$Y1plot-(
        dataprep.out$Y0plot%*%synth.out$solution.w
        ) ; gaps

## also there are three convenience functions to summarize results.
## to get summary tables for all information 
## (V and W weights plus balance btw. 
## treated and synthetic control) use the 
## synth.tab() command
synth.tables <- synth.tab(
      dataprep.res = dataprep.out,
      synth.res = synth.out)
print(synth.tables)

## to get summary plots for outcome trajectories 
## of the treated and the synthetic control unit use the 
## path.plot() and the gaps.plot() commands

## plot in levels (treated and synthetic)
path.plot(dataprep.res = dataprep.out,synth.res = synth.out)

## plot the gaps (treated - synthetic)
gaps.plot(dataprep.res = dataprep.out,synth.res = synth.out)
